<h2><b>REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEMS</b></h2>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">We <b>SEE</b>, we remember things we
have seen, we imagine things we are going to see.  We make visual
images which are either remembered or imagined.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">We <b>HEAR</b>:
words, sounds, music.  We remember things we have heard, we imagine
or construct things we are going to hear (what we are going to say
next, in a conversation, for example)</font></font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">We <b>FEEL</b>:
 emotions (feelings) and sensations (also feelings!).  We can
remember feelings, and imagine how things are going to feel.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">We <b>SMELL</b>:
 Smells, because the sensory center in the brain bypases the cerebral
cortex in the brain and go straight to the primitive brain, the site
of emotions, are very powerful in evoking feelings – hence perfume!
 We can remember smells, and can imagine how something is going to
smell.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">We <b>TASTE</b>:
 Closely connected to smell, tastes can also evoke powerful
associations and feelings.  After all, our sense of taste has a lot
to do with survival in terms of making sure we are selective about
what we eat.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">Once we become aware of
how our brain processes our sensory experiences, we can have much
more control about our responses, our subjective state. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><br>
</p><h2><b>ASSOCIATION-DISSOCIATION</b></h2>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">When we
remember an event, do we <b>RE-LIVE</b> it, or <b>RE-VIEW</b> it?</font></font></p>

<h3>ASSOCIATION – RELIVING</h3>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">Think of a
time when you were feeling really good.  Now imagine that you are
right back <b>in</b> that time, seeing around you what was around you
at the time, hearing what you were hearing, feeling the sensations of
that experience.  As you do this, recalling colours, sounds, voices,
and perhaps smells or tastes (was it by the sea, or in the woods, or
was it a lovely meal you were enjoying in good company) – you will
more and more strongly re-experience the good feelings of that time.</font></font></p><font size="3"><font size="4">This
process is called <b>association</b>, and is very useful in evoking
(accessing) <b>resource states</b>, which you can then link to an
<b>anchor</b>, a gesture, word, or symbol (or all three) to make use
of in any situation where you need those feelings.  (Confidence, when
approaching an interview, calmness when a situation usually produces
a stress reaction, boredom when confronted with something that has
been quite irritating.)  Linking the anchor to an anticipated
situation is called <b>future-pacing</b>.</font></font>

<h3>DISSOCIATION – RE-VIEWING</h3>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">Now, think
of a situation which you found <i>mildly</i> annoying or worrying.
(While learning this process, practice with memories which have a
<i>slight</i> negative feeling connected to them.) </font></font>
</p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="3"><font size="4">Take the
one you are working with, and imagine that someone has taped it, so
that you are now <b>watching a video of it</b> and can <b>see
yourself in it,</b> <b>hear what you are saying</b>, <b>see yourself</b>
experiencing whatever you were experiencing in that situation.  Keep
the (mental) TV screen fairly small and fairly far away.  <b>How do
you, here, in the present, in this room, watching that going on, feel
<i>towards</i> the “you” in the experience you are watching?  </b>How
do you evaluate it?  As an objective, outside observer, what can you
now notice and learn about that situation that you were not aware of
while “in” the experience?  What would you like to say to the
participants?  Where does power and responsibility lie?  Do you have
any advice or helpful suggestions to make to the “you” in the
situation?  Throughout this process, keep a definite visual image of
the “you” in the event – do whatever you need to do to keep in
the present, here-and-now position of <b>observer.</b></font></font></p>
<font size="3"><font size="4">This
process, <b>dissociation</b>, is an important tool in keeping out of
feeling stressed by any event.  You can use it on the spot, when the
heat is on, imagining that you are in another part of the room,
watching an interaction between yourself and someone else.  You can
even walk over to another part of the room, to help you to make an
immediate dissociation from the stressed “you” to you as the
“observer”.</font></font><br>

<p class="western" align="justify"> 
</p>

<h2>PERCEPTUAL POSITIONS</h2>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">Learning to make
conscious and deliberate use of the ability either to associate into,
or dissociate from a particular situation gives us the tools for
adopting different perceptual positions.   This is particularly
useful in one-to-one negotiations, in either work or personal
settings.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">You are discussing some
issue with another person, it is getting heated, and agreement is not
easy to reach.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">The First Perceptual
Position is experiencing the situation from inside your own skin –
your ideas, thoughts and feelings.  Allow yourself to become fully
aware of this.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">The Second Perceptual
Position involves associating into the experience of the other
person.  Imagine how that person is feeling, imagine saying what that
person is saying, as much as possible adopt the posture and gestures
of that person so that you can as closely as possible experience the
situation from their position – seeing and hearing yourself as you
look and sound to that person.  This usually gives us quite a deep
understanding of “where they are coming from”, and can be very
enlightening.</font></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">The Third Perceptual
Position involves stepping right outside the interaction and looking
and listen from the dissociated perspective of an outside observer. 
What do both of you look and sound like to an outsider?  How does it
feel to be “outside” the situation?  </font>
</p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><font size="4">Having adopted all
three of these positions, and making use of the understanding and
empathy, and objectivity, which is now available to you, become an
understanding coach to “you” in the First Position.  Give
yourself some advice, follow it, and see how the negotiation
proceeds. </font>
