<h1>Jokes and Humour for the Day</h1>





<p>A PANDA WALKS INTO A PUB AND ASKS FOR A SANDWICH.  HE EATS THE SANDWICH, GETS OUT A PISTOL, SHOOTS THE BARTENDER. AND WALKS OUT THE DOOR.  &ldquo;WHY DID YOU DO THAT?&rdquo; SHOUTS A BYSTANDER.  &ldquo;LOOK IT UP&rdquo;, SAYS THE PANDA, &ldquo;THE PANDA EATS SHOOTS AND LEAVES.&rdquo;

<p>A MAN ACCOSTS A WOMAN ON THE BUS.  &ldquo;EXCUSE ME, MA&rsquo;AM, BUT DID YOU REALISE YOU&rsquo;VE GOT A TAMPON BEHIND YOUR EAR?&rdquo;  &ldquo;OH DEAR&rdquo;, SHE REPLIES, &ldquo;I WONDER WHAT I&rsquo;VE DONE WITH MY PENCIL!&rdquo;

<p>A WOMAN COMPLAINS TO HER DOCTOR THAT HER HUSBAND SEEMS TO BE LOSING INTEREST IN HER.  &ldquo;I MAY HAVE JUST THE THING FOR YOU&rdquo; SAYS THE DOCTOR, &ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S A SAMPLE A DRUG COMPANY ARE TESTING RIGHT NOW.  JUST SLIP IT INTO HIS COFFEE AFTER DINNER AND BE SURE TO LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.&rdquo;  THE NEXT DAY SHE REAPPEARS, GLOWING, AND TELLS HIM &ldquo;I DID WHAT YOU SAID, AND HE JUST GOT UP, SWEPT THE DISHES OFF THE TABLE, AND MADE LOVE TO ME RIGHT THERE AND THEN!&rdquo;   &ldquo;WONDERFUL!&rdquo;, SAYS THE DOCTOR, &ldquo;AND I&rsquo;M SURE THE DRUG COMPANY WILL BE GLAD TO REIMBURSE YOU FOR THE COST OF THE BROKEN CHINA&rdquo;.  &ldquo;OH, DOCTOR, I&rsquo;M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT&rdquo; SAYS THE WOMAN,  &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T THINK WE&rsquo;LL BE GOING BACK TO THAT RESTAURANT AGAIN!&rdquo;

<p>IT&rsquo;S A TERRIBLY HOT DAY.  A SOMEWHAT OVERWEIGHT, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN IS CARRYING A COUPLE OF BIG BAGS OF GROCERIES, AND DROPS ONE ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SITS DOWN AND CRIES, AS TWO EGGS AND A WHOLE BOTTLE OF KETCHUP  SPREAD ACROSS THE PAVEMENT.  A DRUNK COMES UP, SURVEYS THE SITUATION, PATS HER ON THE SHOULDER AND SAYS &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T CRY, LADY, IT WOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE BEEN NORMAL ANYWAY, THE EYES WAS TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.&rdquo;






<p>SCINTILLATE<br><br>

<p>I HAVE OUTLIVED <br>
MY YOUTHFULNESS<br>
SO A QUIET LIFE FOR ME<br>
WHERE ONCE I USED TO <br>
SCINTILLATE<br><br>

<p>NOW I SIN<br>
TILL TEN<br>
PAST THREE.



<p>THOSE WHO SAY MONEY CAN&rsquo;T BUY HAPPINESS
DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHERE TO SHOP
