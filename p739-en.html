<h1>My Poems and Songs</h1>





<p>Not all the poems and songs are about people I am or have been in love with.  Some of the poems are are about people I can't even re
member.  But I still have the poems.<br>
<br>
A Goodby Song<br>
<br>
I know I was in love with somebody<br>
I'm not sure I remember his name<br>
I've searched all thes
e places to find him<br>
But no one here looks quite the same.<br>
<br>
The river flowed on while you waited<br>
Took me to some far distant shore<br>
Don't know if you'r
e standing there, calling<br>
I can't hear your voice any more.<br>
<br>
I thought love had joined us forever<br>
But you let its thread fall from your hand<br>
It laid in
 the dust all unheeded<br>
Died, like a flower in desert sand.<br>
<br>
I know your're not lonely without me<br>
There'll be someone else at your door<br>
Oh stranger, so
mebody once loved you<br>
But she don't call your name anymore<br>
<br>
<br>
There was more to it than that, but it's all a bit excruciating.  Then there is the one about my
 dog, Muttley.<br>
<br>
You know, sometimes you love someone so much, you can't tell the truth about it.  This song is a pack of lies, and is dedicated to my dog, Muttley.<br>
<
br>
Oh I need a lover<br>
And all I've got is you<br>
Pink furry ears<br>
Halitosis too.<br>
<br>
You couldn't even make it with the dog next door<br>
God knows you
 tried<br>
And if trying could have killed you<br>
God knows you would have died<br>
<br>
Oh there's dog-shit on the pavement<br>
And fleas in the bed<br>
And when I co
me home, pissed and wrecked<br>
You're waiting to be fed.<br>
<br>
Oh I need a lover and all I've got is you<br>
Pink furry ears, halitosis too<br>
<br>
I scratch you 
on your tummy<br>
And you try to lick my tits<br>
But let's face it, Muttley, <br>
You're just not it.<br>
<br>
I know that both of us <br>
Are short, and fat<br>
B
ut let's face it Muttley,<br>
You're just not where it's at.<br>
<br>
<br>
(I have also written some very profound, spiritually uplifting poetry and prose but that will hav
e to wait.)<br>
