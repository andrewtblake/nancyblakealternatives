Dr. Simpson is a researcher who has devoted more than thirty years to the study of haemorheology - the physical properties of blood.  It is a medical given that red blood cells are biconcave discocytes - perfectly round and flat, with a dimple on both sides.  This shape enables them to 'deform' (curl up) enough to travel through tiny blood vessels (capillaries) much narrower.  The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen to every cell in our body, and remove waste products.   If this process fails, symptoms will occur in the areas of the body most sensitive to oxygen deprivation - the muscles, cognitive areas of the brain, and the endocrine system which regulates most of our bodily functions.  People who have ME/CFS will recognise the failure of normal functioning in muscles, problems of cognition (''brain fog") and in regulation of body temperature, appetite, sleep rhythms.  Dr. Simpson's studies, involving micrographs of immediately fixed samples of blood show that in ME/CFS, the red blood cell population becomes dominated by a proportions of cells which have shapes other than biconcave discocyte, are therefore stiffened, and unable to traverse the microcirculation.  This account does not explain the initial cause or causes of this debilitating illness, but it does explain how the symptoms are created.

<p>
The good news is that there are a number of easily obtainable supplements which can improve the flexibility of the red blood cells if taken in sufficient dosage.  These include fish oil, 6g per day, genuine Evening Primrose Oil, 4 g per day (following research that appeared to show that EPO was not effective, it was discovered that many products marketed as EPO are not, in fact, genuine), Vitamin B12 as hydroxocobalamin, and pentoxyfilline.

<p>
Dr. Simpson is clear that for reasons unknown, not everyone will respond to one or another of these, and suggests trying them until you find the one that helps you the most.  He has interviewed, researched and advised members of ME and CFS groups in the U.S, U.K., Canada, Australia, and his native New Zealand, and had hundreds of reports from people who had been helped by these recommendations.

<p>
The bad news is that his ideas, along with most research in the field of haemorheology, is ignored by the medical profession and the medical textbooks, so that sufferers from a number of other chronic, illnesses, as well as ME, are deprived of information which could make a major difference to their well-being.

<p>
Nancy Blake is a UKCP-Accredited Neurolinguistic psychotherapist, who became very ill with ME in 1986.  Now virtually fully recovered, she puts forward a strong case  against the psychiatric labelling of ME/CFS, and makes recommendations, based on the physiological nature of this illness, for people who have it, for doctors, and for public policy.

<p>
'Ramsay's Disease' is now available on Amazon Kindle.  It will be produced in paperback within the next few weeks.  It will be followed by a shortened version, 'Common Sense About ME', also to appear within the next few weeks.

<p>
Nancy is also working on a book on DIY Family Therapy, entitled 'Friendly Conversations for Families that are Stuck', and will be producing a book of poetry, 'Dream Landscapes'.  Another project is producing two short books based on talks that she has presented to residents of The Gables, a residential complex in Ojai, California, where her mother spent twenty eight happy years.  And, very belatedly, she plans to write about research she undertook into mental health facilities in the then South Humberside, U.K. in the 1980's.
