<h3>Nancy's Introduction to the Site</h3>

<p>
For those of you who know my site as one mainly concerned with my
professional work as a neurolinguistic psychotherapist, I need to
explain that at the moment my main concern is the current situation
concerning the treatment of people who have myalgic encephalomyelitis
(ME, CFS. ME/CFS, CFS/ME) in most (but not all) Western nations.

<p>
If you have ME, you are most likely to be energetic, ambitious,
generally optimistic, ploughing onward through illness or minor
injuries, the farthest thing from being the hypochondriac of popular
media perception.  You need every bit of help and encouragement you
can get to give yourself a chance to get better - to feel OK that
resting is the right thing to do.  And there are other things which
can help, too, based on Les Simpson's research and recommendations
concerning shape changes in the red-blood cell population.

<p>
If you are visiting this site because you are looking for a
psychotherapist or a piano teacher, or have heard about NLP
(neurolinguistic programming) and would like to learn more, 
please look at my articles.

<!--
<p>Alternatives is the word I chose for what I offer because NLP offers
alternatives to traditional forms of therapy, and because the outcome
we envisage is that you have more alternatives in your own life.  


<p>John Grinder and Richard Bandler are the men who first set out the
principles of NLP.  It began with studying the work of various experts
- watching what they did, rather than listening to what they said
about what they thought they did - a noticing patterns which seemed to
be producing the results they got.  This process is called modelling,
and it has been used to understand the basics of sports performance,
musical performance, successful business practices, management,
teaching, and for our purposes, how to help people change their
behaviour, if that's what they want to do.


<p>The practice of neurolinguistic psychotherapy is based on NLP.
Bandler and Grinder were very interested in the work of the most
successful therapists of their time - the early work was done in the
1970's.  They modelled Virginia Satir, who specialised in family
therapy, Fritz Perls, who used Gestalt therapy, and Dr. Milton
Erickson, who was a leading medical hypnotist.  


<p>If you would like to find out more about NLP, please go to Basics of
NLP.  If you would like to find out about my own approach to
psychotherapy, go to How I Like to Work.  If you are interested in how
I use NLP in teaching piano, go to NLP and The Piano.  If you are
interested in finding out about me, go to Me.  You can also look at My
Poems and Songs,  My Politics, My Bad Attitudes and My Thoughts about
This and That, also My Favourite Jokes.  There is also My Dog,
Muttley.
