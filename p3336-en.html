<h1>NLP: Cult or Cure? Neither, Actually (Positive Health, December 2006)</h1>





<p>(This article originally appeared in <a target="newhtswindow" href="http://www.positivehealth.com/article-view.php?articleid=2014">Positive Health</a> magazine.)</p>

<h3>Controversy in Wikipedia</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">Looking up NLP (Neurolinguistic
Programming) on Wikipedia, I was shocked at finding violent
controversy. NLP was described as a cult, [A religious, or
quasi-religious group, led by a person who claims to have divinely
inspired knowledge of absolute truths, and demands complete control
over followers’ lives (and finances)] and edits which attempted to
present an accurate account of NLP were quickly altered or rejected.
This article is a response.</p>
<h3><br>NLP Modelling: Discovering the Elements of What Works</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">NLP developed because Richard
Bandler, a psychologist and computer modeller, and John Grinder, a
professor of linguistics, decided to model the work of the most
effective psychotherapists of their time, and see if the basic
elements they uncovered could be taught to others. [1]<br><br>Since
then, NLP has modelled expert performance in virtually every field.
(We can also model the sequence of mental activities which produce
depression, and other forms of emotional distress, finding simple
ways to change them.) <br><br>Scientific progress does depend on the
ability of scientists to accept new results even when they appear to
contradict the currently accepted truths. The field of
psycho-neuroimmunology is a recent example, in which experimental
results contradicted the traditional view that the immune system
operated independently of other systems, and outside of the brain.
Now our much more sophisticated understanding of the systems of
neurotransmitters, which are involved in regulating the continuous
interactions between our thought processes, our physiological
functioning and our immune system, allow us to understand how
language can affect health, as well as how many of the ‘unscientific’
traditional and complementary therapies work. [2-3] These concepts are
now used alongside medical technologies in many NHS treatment
environments, especially in the treatment of cancer. [4]<br><br><strong>The
Meta-Model of Language</strong><br>To simplify all of our sensory
input, we make use of generalization, deletion and distortion. The
resulting ‘model of the world’ can limit our choices in unhelpful
ways. For example, the statement ‘I always get rejected’ is a
generalization. A person who has often been rejected has generalized
rejection into the past and the future, deleting reference to times
they were accepted. The therapist can offer gentle linguistic
challenges: “Always? Was there ever a time when you weren’t
rejected?” And, “So up to now, you have often been rejected” –
keeping the future open.</p>
<h3><strong><br></strong>Representational Systems</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">We perceive the external world
through our five senses. We also ‘think’ by representing our
thoughts in the form of visual images, remembered or imagined sounds,
words, music, or physical sensations, or taste and smell. We have
preferred representational systems: one person, remembering a
holiday, will remember scenery, others will remember music or
conversations, the sensations of lying on the beach, or what the food
was like. <br><strong><br>Eye Accessing Cues</strong> <br>The
direction of one’s gaze, when not looking at anything specific,
provides information about whether we are engaging in visual imagery
(if up and to the left, remembering; if up and to the right,
imagining), auditory (words, sounds or music) recall (level left) or
imagining (level right), kinaesthetic (sensations, emotions, motor
activity) remembering or imagining (down right) or internal dialogue
(down left). <br><br>In order to feel depressed, a client will be
looking down, right and left, accessing feelings, then
(self-critical) internal dialogue. If asked to keep the level of
their gaze angled up, the client will be surprised to discover that
it becomes almost impossible to feel depressed. Simply developing the
habit of looking up as much as possible can produce an on-going
improvement in mood. EMDR, a therapy used successfully with
post-traumatic stress disorder, makes use of directed eye movements.</p>
<h3>Submodalities 
</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">Submodalities are the details of how
we make our mental representations. When we talk about our memories
‘fading’, we are referring to a mental process in which our
memories are no longer in big, bright pictures, but in our minds,
seem smaller farther away, less distinct, and in which our emotional
responses have also faded. We don’t have to wait for this to
happen: we can deliberately change the way our mind represents
events. This is another way in which NLP can give us control over our
subjective experience. [5] <br><br>Visual submodalities include
colour/black and white, distance, size, bordered or panoramic, focal
quality (clear or fuzzy), moving or still, and so on. Auditory
submodalities include volume, pitch, tone quality, rhythm, source of
sound, vocal tonality, if speech. Kinaesthetic submodalities include
temperature, texture, weight, dry/wet. Association/dissociation is a
special category that will be discussed below.<br><br><strong>Submodality
Work with Internal Dialogue<br></strong>We know about positive
affirmations, but we don’t believe them! Changing the submodalities
of our critical internal dialogue is more powerful: imagining the
stream of negativity being sung by one of those huge operatic
sopranos, or being played on a run-away tape, beginning to sound like
Mickey Mouse, then like a squeak, destroys its credibility! Bandler
also suggests imagining the internal dialogue being spoken in the
tones of someone who loves you. This changes the emotional impact,
and often the words as well. Said in a loving tone, criticism just
doesn’t make sense. And, as Bandler also says, if there is any
useful advice within the criticism, it is easier to accept if said in
a loving tone. [6]<br><br><strong>Submodality Work with
Memories</strong><br>Sometimes a client will ask a therapist how they
could find out whether a ‘memory’ they are unsure about was a
genuine event, a dream, a fantasy, or family story that they have
heard so often that they imagine they have remembered it.
<br><br>Particularly in the context of recovered memories of abuse,
and the whole ‘false memory syndrome’ controversy, it becomes
very important to clients to have some way of establishing the status
of what might or might not be a ‘memory’. In the context of
therapists being accused of instilling ‘false memories’, it is
also important to have a way of assisting clients that is free from
any contamination in the opinions of the therapist. <br><br>The
client can be asked to think of something he remembers which he knows
did happen, at about the time in question. We then carefully list the
submodalities of that memory: colour or black and white, clear focus
or fuzzy focus, size, distance, boundary or panoramic, and so
on.<br><br>Now we ask him to think of something that could have
happened at that age, but he knows didn’t. (Aunt Gladys, who is
alive and well and living in Ipswich, got knocked down by a bus.) The
submodalities of this ‘memory’, again carefully listed, will be
different in significant ways from those of the genuine memory.
<br>Noting these differences, the client can then think about the
event which he is questioning. The submodalities of that scenario
will either be similar to those of the real memory, or of the created
‘memory’. The client can then come to his own conclusions.
<br><br><strong>Submodalities: Association/Dissociation<br></strong>An
important submodality is association/dissociation. We can remember an
event by virtually re-living it, imagining we are right back in the
situation, seeing what we were seeing, hearing what we were hearing,
feeling what we were feeling at the time. This associated way of
remembering will powerfully evoke the emotions of the time.<br><br>The
opposite process involves keeping a strong sense of one’s self in
the present situation, while imagining that you are watching the
remembered event, as though you were looking at a photograph or a
video recording, seeing yourself in it, re-viewing (not re-living)
the experience. This dissociation is a way to keep out of the
emotions of the event – but perhaps to have feelings towards the
‘you’ experiencing the event, making detached judgments about
what is happening – much as we do when we are watching our
favourite TV series. <br><br><em>Traditional approaches to
psychotherapy have encouraged the client to re-live traumatic events,
associating fully into those memories, re-experiencing the negative
emotions and somehow ‘working through’ them.</em><br><br><em>The
neurolinguistic psychotherapist will take the opposite approach,
encouraging the client to remain as dissociated as possible, while
re-viewing the event from the perspective of their present knowledge,
experience and competence.</em></p>
<h3>Two Examples</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">A child or young person who is
physically or sexually abused will typically label it as their fault,
and feel guilty about it. The abuser is likely to reinforce this
belief, and as an adult the person may feel like a bad person, and
engage in self-destructive activities or relationships. Re-living the
experience runs the danger of simply reinforcing these feelings and
beliefs. If, however, the client, now an adult, and possibly a
parent, can be helped to look at these events from an adult
perspective, it usually becomes evident who is responsible, and where
the guilt lies. (‘How big were you when you were six? What could
you have done? What would you be thinking if that were your own
child?) This re-evaluation usually produces very positive changes in
the client’s self-image.<br><br>A second example might be a person
who is suffering from depression, having nursed a loved one through a
terminal illness. Typically, they will be re-living the most painful
scenes, and feeling guilty that they didn’t do enough, or imagining
that the death was due to some act or neglect, even though the end
was inevitable. If that person can be encouraged to look at those
scenes from the perspective of an observer, this can help them to see
that they did all they could, and feel some sympathy for the person
that they were, in that painful situation. They can then be reminded
that the person they loved would not want to be remembered only as
they were in the last stages of illness. The client can be encouraged
to let those painful images shrink and fade, in order to allow
happier memories to come to the surface, and be re-lived. <br><br><strong>NLP
Presupposition: The Unconscious is on Our Side</strong><br>NLP uses
‘the unconscious’ to refer to all of our functioning that is
outside of our conscious awareness. It includes all the information
stored in our brain, all the physiological events and processes which
keep us alive. How long would we survive if we had to try to take
conscious control of, for example, the chemical balance of our blood,
our digestive processes, our immune system, the processes involved in
the healing of wounds? All of this operates with the apparent
‘intention’ of maintaining our survival, and that of our species.
We believe that even the things we label as ‘problems’ or
‘symptoms’ are produced as part of this overall intention for our
wellbeing, and whatever ‘part’ of us has produced them needs to
be respected for that intention. (When I became very ill with Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome, I appreciated that it would probably prevent my
following my father’s footsteps into an early fatal
coronary!)<br><strong><br>Language Patterns: The Problem Contains the
Solution</strong><br>Linguistically, Tamara Andreas invites us to
take the statement of the problem and its cause, and turn it around.
In my case (which may apply to lots of women in this era of fat
phobia and age phobia, it was ‘I will never find a good
relationship with a man because I am middle-aged and fat.’
Following Tamara’s instructions, I changed this to ‘I will find a
good relationship because I am middle-aged and fat’. Immediately
‘because I will be loved for myself’ flashed into my mind.
Coincidentally or not, a beautiful person came into my life within a
few months. [8]<br><br><strong>Core Transformation: The Problem Wants
to Lead You to Bliss</strong><br>Connirae Andreas, with her sister
Tamara, have developed a process they call Core Transformation, on a
similar principle. You start with your ‘problem’, or ‘symptom’,
and ask what its positive intention is for you. Then you ask ‘so if
you had that (what it wants for you), what would that give you?
Following this line of questioning, one will usually arrive at what
they call a ‘core state’ – some universal spiritual value –
peace, love, just being, being at one with the universe. Then you
invite the person to experience this state, and then bring it into
all the previous states mentioned, step by step. [9]<br><br><strong>Core
Transformation: My Kinaesthetic Variation</strong><br>I use a
modification of this process, asking the client to access the problem
state where they are, then shake it off and go to another place in
the room. Then I ask how it feels to be there, and how they feel
towards the ‘self’ who has been in the problem state. Then I
repeat the process five or six times. Typically, the first move
elicits sympathy (or sometimes criticism!), the second move elicits
detachment, and subsequent moves allow the client to begin to access
capabilities and strengths, finally approaching what Connirae Andreas
calls a core state. Then I reverse the process, asking the client to
associate fully into the core state, and bring it back to the next to
last position, integrating the core state with the resources of that
position, and continuing to bring the integrated states back through
the sequence until they return to where they were sitting in the
problem state. Here a lot of processing goes on, and when this is
completed, the client usually feels very different. This powerful
process often results in the client going out of the session and
implementing positive changes in their life situation. 
</p>
<h3>The Symptom Path to Enlightenment [10]</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">Ernest Rossi, a medical hypnotist
who worked closely with Dr Milton Erickson and documented much of his
work, uses a technique of asking the client to allow conflicting
aspects of their problem to go into their hands (‘I don’t know
which hand this part is going to go into’). He then closely watches
small movements, skin colour changes, breathing patterns, and makes
very open, but always positive comments: ‘good, very good’ ‘and
there’s a lot going on there’. <br><br>This method and the
research behind it is documented in his book cited above. As well as
diurnal rhythms, our brains also go through ultradian cycles of about
90 minutes. For ten or 15 minutes in this cycle, our brain rhythms
become more random and chaotic. Rossi believes that it is during this
period that creative changes can take place. His hypnotic technique
provides the mind with a framework for resolution, and encouragement,
but not direction, to allow the mind to come up with its own
solutions. This is evidenced by observation of the processes he is
following as they reach apparent resolution, and the client returns
to conscious awareness. He regards this really as starting off
processes which the unconscious can continue during subsequent
creative periods.</p>
<h3><br>Rapport, Ericksonian Language Patterns, and Influencing with
Integrity</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">Another whole area of NLP concerns
establishing rapport. The more closely you match the posture,
gestures, language patterns, rhythms of small movements, speech and
breathing of the person to whom you are speaking, the more that
person will experience you as understanding and appreciating them.
Once ‘matching and mirroring’, it is possible, if you change what
you are doing slightly, that the person you are with will follow that
change. This is called ‘pacing and leading’.<br><br>A benign
example of this is with a crying baby – closely matching the
breathing patterns and then slowing them down can gently lead a baby
into a calmer state.<br><br>A less benign example would be of the
salesman getting into rapport in order to create a feeling of
bondedness which will help him sell you what he wants to sell you.
Some of the bad press NLP attracts is probably because of its use in
selling – and even, according to the titles of some books on e-bay,
the art of seduction. <br><br>Part of the linguistic subjects taught
on NLP courses includes the use of language in Ericksonian hypnosis.
Dr Milton Erickson was one of the most effective medical hypnotists
of the time, and awareness of his use of language patterns can be a
powerful tool in helping people change their behaviour. [7]<br><br>This
knowledge is also studied by advertisers, in their eternal quest to
influence our behaviour. In fact, this knowledge has become widely
available generally, and like any form of knowledge, can be used or
misused. According to Richard Bandler, every ad we see on TV is an
extremely complex and sophisticated hypnotic induction. We can’t
avoid it, but the more we know about these techniques, the better
armed we are to resist their unwanted effects.<br><br>One of the
early books on NLP in selling is called <em>Influencing with
Integrity</em>.11 If NLP is used to discover how a person arrives at
decisions which work for them, it can be used to ensure that whatever
you are selling is going to be right for that person. If persuasion
is used to sell something the client will regret, that will be the
last sale you will ever make to that person. So, influencing with
integrity makes economic sense.<br>NLP is based on the study of what
already works. It doesn’t discover anything new – it simply
offers a clearer understanding of how successful people achieve their
success. As such, it is used to understand the elements of expertise
in a wide range of activities – sports, musical performance,
management, teaching, and, of special interest to readers of Positive
Health, the achievement and maintenance of good health. 
</p>
<h3>By Understanding the Elements of Persuasion, We Can Better Resist
their Misuse</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 14.2pt;">NLP didn’t invent the techniques
used by con-men and Don Juans down the ages. <br><br>But the study of
NLP offers us the chance to recognize, and when necessary, resist
techniques used by anyone attempting to influence us against our best
interests. (If books have been written about using NLP in the art of
seduction, we should all have a copy – then at least we’ll know
which page they are on!)<br><br>I can understand anger at the misuse
of NLP, and perhaps this accounts for the hostility on Wikipedia. As
for NLP being a cult, I hope this article makes it clear that NLP is
simply a set of tools, or, as Richard Bandler puts it, an operating
manual for the human brain. And, he adds, if we don’t learn to run
our brain ourselves, someone else is going to be running it for us! [5]
<br><br>Not a cult, not a cure, whether we are resisting cults,
advertising, media persuasion, political propaganda, or successfully
improving our health, our relationships, our practical skills,
understanding the principles of NLP will help us always to be the one
who is in charge in our own lives.
