        </b> </font><font color="black">      In my early 
        adulthood, this urge to understand became focused on seeking knowledge 
        that could link all the influences on human behaviour. Starting with genetics, 
        moving through the relations to the mother, the father, siblings, peers, 
        this understanding would have to include the effects of specific life 
        events and broaden out to the influence of education, cultural influences, 
        going back in time back through the history of the individual, the family, 
        including previous generations, the ethnic group, the nation, the religion. 
        Externally, this study would lead outwards from the individual to the 
        political. Internally, it would move from the individual into physiology: 
        organs, systems, right down to the cellular level. Obviously no one person 
        could gain all this knowledge, yet it seemed equally obvious that one 
        could not understand human beings by considering just one or two of these 
        elements.<br>
             But education was split: mathematics and 
        science were opposed to 'soft' topics: literature, languages, social studies. 
        Psychology was split, with clinical and experimental psychologists in 
        separate and warring camps. Freud or Eysenck, psychodynamic theories or 
        behaviourism: there was no common ground; you believed in one or the other. 
        At Boston University, where I studied (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), the 
        Department of Clinical Psychology and the Department of Experimental Psychology 
        were located in separate buildings, half a mile apart!</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Barriers 
        to Making the Necessary Paradigm Shift<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     As practitioners 
        or clients of what are known as holistic, alternative or complementary 
        therapies, we are constantly made aware of the split between 'science-based' 
        allopathic medicine, which mostly looks at symptoms of 'diseases', single 
        causes and single 'cures', most usually in the form of a prescription 
        drug; and our practice, which attempts to understand the whole individual 
        in the context of the entire environment, external and internal.<br>
             Although today the splits are healing, Western 'allopathic' medicine and the holistic practices have traditionally been 
        at daggers drawn. We who practise from a holistic perspective too often 
        find ourselves criticized and discounted by the reigning paradigms of 
        the medical professions. The field of psychoneuroimmunology, largely pioneered 
        by Candace Pert and like-minded researchers in previously separate disciplines, 
        is the major factor in bringing these approaches together.</font></p>
      <p> <strong>Science<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>Science 
        has been regarded as the only source of valid truth. When science 'discovers' 
        something that healing traditions have taught for thousands of years, 
        suddenly it is given credence. Scientific method, based on carefully controlled 
        experiments designed to test one or two hypotheses at a time, which must 
        be verifiable through the ability of other scientists or scientific laboratories 
        to study the method, reproduce the experiments, and get the same, or very 
        similar results, does provide ways to approach certain types of truth. 
        But like any other field of endeavour, it can be influenced by prejudice, 
        fashion, self-interest -- and the very human difficulty in giving up long-held 'truths' when new information challenges the accepted ideas about how 
        the world works. Advancement in the scientific world depends upon getting 
        funding for research (very difficult if one's work undermines or contradicts 
        accepted beliefs), getting publication (which also can be difficult if 
        one's work is original enough to depart from accepted beliefs -- the reigning 
        paradigm), and getting other scientists interested enough to do the work 
        of verification.</p>
      <p> <strong>Physics<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>Physics, 
        regarded as the epitome of the 'hard' sciences, gives us an example of 
        a 'paradigm shift'. Before 1900, Newtonian mechanics was thought to be 
        potentially able to explain all physical processes, and its model of the 
        world seemed unchallengeable, until relativity theory came along and paradoxes 
        were discovered, such as the fact that certain aspects of the way light 
        performed could <i>only</i> be explained if it was thought of as waves, 
        and other aspects could <i>only</i> be explained if it was thought of 
        as separate tiny units: quanta. Despite incontrovertible experimental 
        evidence demonstrating these new ideas, many physicists of Einstein's 
        day were simply unable to make the shift in thinking required by the new 
        paradigm.</p>
      <p> <strong>Dichotomized Thinking<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>Another 
        limitation on our ability to deal with complex ideas is a Western tradition, 
        going back to Plato, of dichotomized thinking, that is, thinking in terms 
        of polar opposites: black-white, off-on, right-wrong. These are mutually 
        exclusive -- if I am right, then you are wrong. There are more flexible 
        models of thinking involving 'shades' of right or wrong and even more 
        complex situations involving feedback loops: systems in which information 
        fed back has a regulatory effect. In these more complex examples, 'right-wrong' 
        thinking isn't going to be adequate to describe what is going on.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>Take the familiar 
        story of the five blind men trying to figure out the elephant. The one 
        holding the tail assures the others that the elephant is like a rope. 
        The one holding the ear contradicts him: the elephant is demonstrably 
        like a large leaf. And so on, through the one holding the trunk, the one 
        holding a leg, and the one leaning against the side. Each can 'prove' 
        that the other is wrong, but no matter how 'right' the winner is, no one 
        is going to be able to find out much about the elephant.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>If, instead, the 
        gentlemen in question respected one another's information, accepted it 
        as accurate, and asked questions that allowed them to fill out the picture 
        ('How far are you from me?' -- 'How high from the ground is the part you 
        are holding?' and so on) this collaborative (systemic) rather than competitive 
        way of approaching the problem is going to produce a much more accurate 
        description of the elephant. Human beings are much more complex than the 
        elephant, at least when taking into account feelings, behaviour, and all 
        the internal functions required for our continued life. Medical science, 
        however, has been limited by its laboratory techniques, the simplified 
        mathematical models it has had to use, and by competitive rather than 
        collaborative thinking among different specialities.</p>

        of the Emotions on Health<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     Psychologists 
        have studied emotions, thought processes and behaviour. Endocrinologists 
        have studied the complex functions of the glands, which regulate many 
        of our bodily functions (and which respond to perceptions and emotions). 
        Neurologists have studied the brain and the nervous system. Immunologists 
        have studied the immune system. (Experimental methods involving taking 
        elements of the immune system and studying them in test tubes had, by 
        default, supported the assumption that the immune system is not influenced 
        by other systems in the body.)<br>
             In the middle years of the 20th century, 
        scientists who were studying the stress response began to provide both 
        statistical and physiological evidence to support the common-sense view 
        that emotions do affect health, although there were still many questions 
        to be answered.</font></p>
      <p> <strong>Examples<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>I am 
        ten years old, coming home from my friend's house, in the dark. With the 
        help of wind blowing through the autumn leaves, my imagination conjures 
        up Someone Following Me. Terror rises, I start to run, and the running 
        itself increases the terror. Fear has produced biochemical reactions that 
        enable me to run even faster, impelled by the feeling of terror that produces 
        and is produced by these biochemical reactions. I get home, and glance 
        round to see a peaceful, empty street. All this has been produced just 
        by an idea.</p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Terror rises, 
        I start to run, and the running itself increases the terror</font></p>
      <p> <font color="black">     </font> Relatively early 
        in my career as a psychotherapist, a young man I had been working with 
        mentioned in passing that during the course of the therapy, he had become 
        unable to drink his usual six or eight pints of beer a night. Yet drinking 
        had never been discussed. What had been happening to his metabolism?</p>
      <p> <font color="black">     </font>More recently, 
        a client asked me to help her to stop smoking. She told me she had to, 
        because her blood pressure was dangerously high and she had reacted badly 
        to every medication offered by her doctor. Smoking, however, provided 
        her with an excuse to go out in the garden and spend a few minutes away 
        from her domineering and critical husband, and I felt concerned about 
        the loss of this opportunity. I did a hypnotic induction about breathing 
        fresh air, etc., mentioning more or less in passing that her unconscious 
        could remember how it used to be able to regulate the pulse of blood through 
        her body just exactly as was needed. She came back the next week: she 
        was still smoking, but her blood pressure had returned to normal. (Her 
        doctor couldn't understand it, so she told him about what I had done. '<i>That</i> won't have anything to do with it', he assured her!)</p>
      <p> <font color="black">     </font>Another client 
        suffering from diabetes used memories of riding horseback -- the lovely 
        horsey smells, the feeling of the wind in her hair as she galloped along -- to associate into a time of happiness and good health. Her blood sugar 
        count began to drop. 'How does this work', became part of my questioning.</p>
      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What Does 
        Psychoneuroimmunology Have to Do with It?<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     Candace Pert, 
        PhD, is a neuroscientist who for many years led a research laboratory 
        within America's prestigious National Institutes of Health. She is now 
        Research Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Georgetown 
        University Medical Center in Washington, DC. Her original research centred 
        around the study of opiate receptors in the brain. In her book,<i><font size="2">1</font></i> 
        defending a feminine approach to her subject (she ascribes much of her 
        success to the female brain's ability to entertain more than one way of 
        thinking at a time), she interweaves her personal history, the course 
        of her scientific research, and the course of her struggles with the male-dominated 
        world of science, as her work and that of her colleagues took her closer 
        and closer to understanding how all of our systems, traditionally studied 
        separately, are interlinked by 'information substances', which are also 
        the molecules of emotion.<br>
             In the early 1900s, the idea that mind and 
        body were entirely separate from one another was supported by research 
        which used the inability of large molecules of dye to cross the membrane 
        containing the brain to confirm the 'brain-blood' barrier. In the second 
        half of the last century, however, researchers had demonstrated that certain 
        chemicals, secreted by the glands, interacted not only with other organs, 
        but also with cells in the hypothalamus, the part of the lower brain associated 
        with emotions, and with regulation of responses such as those of my physiology 
        when I was fearfully running from an imagined danger, the stress response.<br>
             At the beginning of her career, Candace 
        Pert developed ways to study the distribution of opiate receptors in the 
        brain, and found that these receptors appeared not just in the hypothalamus, 
        but in other parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex (the centre 
        of consciousness), and in other parts of the body. The body is also able 
        to produce natural opiates, such as endorphin, which is one of many small-celled 
        substances called peptides which serve the function of regulating physiological 
        functions, and their study also led Pert to believe that as well as affecting 
        our physiology, they are associated with emotions. (My subjective experience 
        of fear was associated with the production of adrenaline and noradrenaline, 
        which set off a shower of peptides enhancing my physiological ability 
        to engage successfully in a 'flight' response -- to run faster. As I engaged 
        in 'flight' behaviour, this response, both emotional and physiological, 
        was strengthened. And all this, useful in escaping from a real danger, 
        was generated, in this instance, not by danger, but by my perception of 
        danger: <i>my imagination</i>.)<br>
             Pert's work led to the study of many other 
        peptides, and receptors for these were also found in the brain and in 
        other parts of the body. Endocrinologists had previously thought that 
        these substances were secreted by the various regulatory glands and proceeded 
        directly to the organs which they regulated. Now it appeared that these 
        responses were mediated through the brain, including the frontal cortex -- the conscious mind.<br>
             Science had finally recognized the intimate 
        links between 'mind' and 'body'. Still, the brain was considered the locus 
        of the mind, and therefore of the self -- our sense of ourselves as both 
        actors and spectators to our actions, <i>conscious awareness,</i> which 
        is believed to be the ultimate distinction between human beings and other 
        animals.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A New Model 
        of the Immune System<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     The immune 
        system, however, still resided safely in its test tubes, and was still 
        believed to operate independently of other systems in the body. We consisted, 
        apparently, of body-mind, and the immune system. The major breakthrough, 
        with all its implications for having to rethink completely our ideas about 
        consisting of separate, independent systems, was made in 1982, by Edward 
        Blalock. Blalock had been studying interferons, peptides made by lymphocytes, 
        cells that are part of the immune system. He did an experiment consisting 
        of putting lymphocytes in a dish and stimulating them to produce interferons. 
        To his amazement, he discovered that the lymphocytes were producing a 
        number of <i>other</i> peptides, previously thought to be produced only 
        by glands in the endocrine system. It seemed that each immune-system cell 
        was a little peptide-producing factory, producing as well as receiving 
        peptides: the molecules of information, the molecules of emotion, which 
        had already been found in the brain and other sites throughout the body. 
        Predictably, attempts were made to discredit this information, it was 
        so counter to the accepted model of the immune system. However, Pert and 
        her co-workers immediately began to explore this possibility, and eventually 
        there were too many confirmations and extensions of Blalock's original 
        work for it to be dismissed.<br>
             'What we were now seeing was astounding 
        and very revolutionary. The immune system was potentially capable of both 
        sending information to the brain via immunopeptides and of receiving information 
        from the brain via neuropeptides (which hooked up with receptors on the 
        immune cell surfaces). Our work confirmed Blalock by pointing irrefutably 
        to the existence of a chemical mechanism through which the immune system 
        could communicate not only with the endocrine system but with the nervous 
        system and the brain as well. Previous work my colleagues and I had done 
        demonstrated quite convincingly that the brain communicated with many 
        other bodily systems. But the immune system had always been considered 
        separate from the other systems. Now we had definitive proof that this 
        was not the case.<i><font size="2">2</font></i><br>
             The 'information substances', which are 
        also the molecules of emotion, link a network which <i>includes</i> the 
        immune system, part of our system which is designed to learn, to remember 
        and to adapt. Linked with the rest of our physiology, this means that 
        we can, on a conscious and an unconscious level, communicate with our 
        immune system, as our immune system communicates with the rest of us. 
        All of our cells are linked in an intricate dance of these networks of 
        communication, of emotion. Emotions influence immunity; the immune system 
        influences emotions.<br>
             In her book, Pert makes many connections 
        between her scientific research and that of her colleagues, and holistic 
        practices. She points out that memories, with the associated emotions, 
        can be 'frozen' within certain muscular configurations, which supports 
        practices such as healing massage and bioenergetics. Nodal points, where 
        there are concentrations of particular peptides and peptide receptors, 
        appear to correspond to the traditional acupuncture points used in Chinese 
        medicine. 'Conscious breathing, the techniques employed by both the yogi 
        and the woman in labor, is extremely powerful. There is a wealth of data 
        showing that changes in the rate and depth of breathing produce changes 
        in the quantity and kind of peptides that are released from the brain 
        stem. And vice versa!'<font size="2"><i>3</i></font> Emotions are seen 
        as the link between our conscious, subjective experience, and the complex 
        regulatory processes that take place in the body, 'the nexus between matter 
        and mind, going back and forth between the two and influencing both'.<i><font size="2">4</font></i><br>
             The links between cancer (in which the immune 
        system has become unable to deal effectively with potentially cancerous 
        cells) and the suppression of emotion, particularly anger; the links between 
        susceptibility to heart attack and the overly hostile personality, between 'feeling happy' and having a high resistance to some viral infections, 
        are only some of the areas of research that are illuminated by this new 
        knowledge. (A simple example is Pert's speculation that we don't get colds 
        when we are happily looking forward to something -- in her case, skiing -- because norepenephrine, an informational substance associated with happy 
        frames of mind, blocks the receptors through which the rheovirus -- a cause 
        of the viral cold -- normally enters the cells.<i><font size="2">5</font></i></font></p>
      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>And NLP!<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     Many articles 
        about NLP have been published in <i>Positive Health</i>, and it is too 
        extensive a field to cover in a brief addendum. NLP deals with the way 
        we code our thought processes, in particular the ways we code experiences 
        that let us know <i>how to feel</i> about them. To go back to my ten-year-old 
        self, running in terror through a windy night landscape, my responses 
        in this case were entirely generated by an imagined image of a dark and 
        frightening pursuer, to which I ascribed an intention to harm me. When, 
        from the safety of my front porch, I dared to look around at what the 
        scene actually was, I saw an empty street, lamp-lit at intervals, and 
        trees blowing in the wind. Much later in my life, when my work had brought 
        me into contact with some realistically frightening, somewhat psychopathic 
        individuals, I used to counter my fear of the dark by imagining that these 
        dangerous individuals were there as protectors!</font></p>
      <p> <strong>Personal Testimony<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>My father 
        died at the age of 62, of a coronary thrombosis. Knowing now that hostility 
        is a better predictor of a coronary attack than any other factor, including 
        smoking (he gave up smoking, but didn't know that he also should have 
        given up being angry!) and that the Type A, impatient, aggressive personality 
        is also implicated, I could say that his habit of rages finally got the 
        better of him. I used to be pretty good at rage, and I definitely have 
        a Type A personality. Having burned the candle at both ends for a number 
        of years, and become physically and emotionally stressed and exhausted, 
        at the age of 50 I was literally struck down by a mysterious illness which 
        left me unable to cross the room, or open drawers, or even sit for more 
        than a few minutes without extreme discomfort and distress. It was as 
        though I had climbed a mountain too quickly, with every symptom of the 
        consequences except being out of breath. After this went on for several 
        weeks, with no indication of a change, I began to feel very frightened. 
        Was it leukaemia? MS? Was it going to get worse? Would I die? Eventually 
        a friend brought me an article about the mysterious illness, myalgic encephalomyelitis 
        (ME). It seemed to describe very accurately what I had been experiencing, 
        and I found it reassuring that there was no fixed diagnostic test, no 
        treatment, just that one needed to heed the body's need for rest. The 
        literature said that if you had had the illness for two years, there was 
        a 50% chance of being fully recovered in six years. So I didn't have to 
        worry if there was not much improvement in a few weeks or months, or pester 
        my doctor for tests or treatments.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>I was very fortunate 
        in that family and friends helped me in many ways, that I got a new job 
        which included control over my own timetable, a telephone allowance and 
        a mileage allowance (going to meetings and writing reports), and that 
        my son and his friends were mostly unemployed and therefore free to drive 
        me to meetings and push my wheelchair. ME, now known as chronic fatigue 
        syndrome (CFS), is a desperate, life-destroying tragedy to many, if not 
        most sufferers, as doctors become hostile, family and friends and employers 
        may be unsympathetic, and for many years it was not possible to get any 
        form of disability allowance, on the grounds that the disability is not 
        permanent. (But the more one has to do, physically, in the 'early' stages, 
        the more likely it is to become permanent.) However, I have not brought 
        this up to enter into the debate about CFS, but rather to make a point 
        about NLP.<br>
        I am like my father in temperament as well as physically in other ways. 
        On a conscious and unconscious level, I had wondered if I, too, would 
        die of a heart attack at the age of 62. In this frame, my illness came 
        like a knight in shining armour, to rescue me from my possible destiny: 
        if I had an illness that meant I had to lie down for five years, I was 
        very unlikely to die of a heart attack!</p>

      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Language 
        of NLP</b></font></p>
      <p> <font color="black"><strong>Reframing<br>
        </strong>      In the language of NLP, the tragedy 
        of this illness was reframed as a life- saving event, and I am sure that 
        this attitude has done a great deal to help me both to adapt ruthlessly 
        in order to conserve energy for activities that really mattered, and to 
        keep the illness from becoming my identity, instead of just something 
        that was going on in my life along with many other things. Reframing, 
        as this example demonstrates, can be a very powerful tool in relation 
        to health issues.</font></p>
      <p> <strong>Coding Experiences at Logical Levels<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>The topic 
        known in NLP as 'logical levels' also comes into this. We experience some 
        things as part of our environment, some as things we do, some as abilities, 
        some as beliefs and values, and some as part of our identity, or even, 
        at a higher level, our spiritual connectedness -- our sense of our relationship 
        to higher universal values. The lower we code things on this scale, the 
        easier they can be to deal with. If CFS is one thing that is going on, 
        something that requires that I do a few things differently, it is going 
        to be easy to let it fade out of my life. If being a CFS sufferer becomes 
        part of my identity, I am going to have a big space to fill when it goes, 
        and if it becomes my spiritual mission to deal with it, I could even lose 
        a sense of my life's purpose if I 'got better'. It is useful to keep ill 
        health coded as part of something that happens, and being fully healthy 
        as part of our identity, our mission.</p>
      <p> <strong>Associated and Dissociated Memories<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>On a 
        very practical level, NLP makes use of the distinction between associated 
        and dissociated memories. When one assists a client to dissociate from 
        a traumatic memory, and to consider it from the perspective of an observer, 
        several changes can take place. The client who may have been self-blaming 
        (therefore sending unhealthy peptides around their bodies) can begin to 
        reassign their perception of power and responsibility. The adult, who 
        may also be a parent, can see that as a child they had neither power nor 
        responsibility for events such as a parent's depression, marital conflict, 
        or physical or sexual abuse, and shed the 'victim guilt' which can shadow 
        one's adult life. The carer of a demanding and critical invalid, who may 
        be feeling very guilty about angry thoughts and feelings, can be helped 
        to look at the situation from the perspective of a sympathetic friend, 
        to see and appreciate the fine job they are doing. These changes can affect 
        long-standing emotional patterns, shifting the patterns of peptides circulating 
        in the body from unhealthy to health enhancing.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>Seeking out memories 
        of life- enhancing experiences, times when our client was happy, healthy, 
        experiencing high levels of well-being, and assisting our client to associate 
        fully into these memories ('see what you were seeing, hear what you were 
        hearing, be in the memory') will encourage the production of peptides 
        which can restore the patterns of good health associated with that time. 
        Hence the lowering of blood pressure, the lowering of the blood sugar 
        count, in the clients mentioned in the examples above. I can only surmise 
        that the client in the first example also had, as a result of resolving 
        some painful issues, returned to a healthier intolerance for poisoning 
        his system with alcohol.</p>
      <p> <strong>Our Representational Systems and Their Submodalities<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>We perceive 
        the world through our five senses, and think about it also in terms of 
        visual images, sounds, words or music, feelings (sensations and emotions) 
        smells and tastes, and an important subcategory of sound called internal 
        dialogue. Within these representational systems are the qualities, or 
        submodalities, of these representations. Association and dissociation, 
        already discussed, are important submodalities, whether you are 'in' a 
        memory, or outside, looking at it from another perspective. Working with 
        other submodalities can also be helpful: clients can be asked to represent 
        good health to themselves in a number of ways -- a clearly focused, life-sized, 
        realistic colour, three-dimensional moving picture, complete with movement 
        and sound, of what they would be like in a state of well-being, projected 
        into wherever they see the future, can help shape their entire system 
        into a movement towards that way of being.</p>
      <p> <strong>Shifting the Tonality of Our Internal Dialogue<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>One of 
        the most useful submodality changes that NLP offers is a shift in the 
        tonality of our internal (usually self- critical) dialogue. (I think that 
        when we talk to, or criticize ourselves, we are just replaying inner 'tapes' 
        of things our parents said -- or shouted -- when they were either angry 
        at us or frightened for us. In that sense, negative as they often seem, 
        these remembered voices are speaking out of concern for our welfare.) 
        The problem with the positive affirmations which we are encouraged to 
        use to counteract negative self-talk is that we don't believe them! When 
        we keep the negative words (which we do believe because we have heard 
        them so often!), but start to play with their tonality, interesting things 
        can happen. Speeding the voice up, as though on a runaway tape, until 
        it becomes a series of squeaks and then disappears into a frequency we 
        can no longer hear, can often make the words meaningless, and bring a 
        smile to our face. Another ploy is to imagine them being sung by one of 
        those vast opera singers, in a hugely melodramatic style. If this makes 
        the negative words sound ridiculous, that can be useful. Bandler recommends 
        imagining the words being spoken in the tonality that would be used by 
        someone who really loved us, (or the tonality we might use to a baby or 
        tiny animal: that 'awwww, isn't it sweet' tonality). That can produce 
        results, either that the words make no sense at all, completely change 
        their meaning, or that the words themselves actually change -- in ways 
        that will be good for our immune system!</p>
      <p> <strong>Pessimism and Optimism<br>
        </strong> <font color="black">     </font>Pessimism 
        and optimism are overall states of mind that have bad or good effects 
        on health. In the book <i>NLP and Health</i> by Ian McDermott and Joseph 
        O'Connor, the 'pessimism and optimism strategies' are spelled out.<i><font color="black" size="2">6</font></i><br>
        <font color="black">     </font>The pessimist takes 
        a bad experience, generalizes it ('this is what life is like') and blames 
        him or herself ('this has happened because of the kind of person I am') 
        and projects it into the future ('this is the kind of thing that always 
        happens to me'). Good experiences and experiences of success are coded 
        as rare accidents for which the individual cannot take any credit.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>The optimist reverses 
        this style of thinking. Bad experiences are one-offs, from which one can 
        learn, and which are mostly due to external factors. Generally the universe 
        is a benign place, and when I am successful, I can take credit for it, 
        and think of it as a result of the kind of person I am.<br>
        <font color="black">     </font>In fact, good things 
        and bad things happen; some are not within our power to influence and 
        some are. As we go through life, we will encounter some good and helpful 
        people and some who are not. The way we choose to think about this <i>is</i> 
        within our power to influence, and it is <i>the way we choose to think 
        </i>that will influence the way we move through the world, and the way 
        that we affect our mood-peptides-immune system!</p>
      <p> <font color="#3333ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>In Conclusion<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black">     The Western 
        medical model is tremendously effective with many injuries and illnesses. 
        But it often overlooks the fact that it can only work its miracles in 
        conjunction with the healing powers of the body-mind. Some forms of treatment, 
        such as the use of antibiotics, while freeing my generation from the fear 
        of many illnesses and infections that used to be life-threatening, do, 
        in the long term, undermine the body's natural defences. Stress, depression, 
        low self-esteem make us vulnerable to biological agents that we can normally 
        fight off.<br>
             We also know that there are a whole range 
        of dis-eases with which Western medicine appears to be relatively helpless: 
        disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erethematosis, and, some 
        believe, CFS, in which the immune system seems to be 'confused' into attacking 
        the body; allergies, in which the immune system responds massively to 
        a normally harmless substance; disorders such as motor-neurone disease, 
        in which inappropriately programmed cell death (apoptosis) gradually destroys 
        a particular set of brain cells; cancer, in which the programmed cell 
        death that normally protects the body from endless proliferation of certain 
        tissues fails to take place. These could all be described as 'misunderstandings' 
        of the immune system, misunderstandings that Candace Pert might see as 
        possible effects of the blocking or distortion of the flow of information 
        substances, the flow of emotion.<br>
             In so far as our holistic approaches to 
        helping our clients achieve positive health can have a positive effect 
        on immune system functioning, we have a contribution to make with these 
        types of disorder, and there is enough evidence already to support the 
        effectiveness of complementary approaches so that some are, as we know, 
        being, albeit reluctantly, welcomed into the mainstream of conventional 
        treatments. Still there will remain many doctors who will assure patients 
        reporting improvements based on complementary treatments that '<i>That 
        </i>won't have anything to do with it!'<br>
             Finally, the excitement for me in reading 
        Candace Pert's book and learning about psychoneuroimmunology is that it 
        recognizes and explains the complex interactions that have fascinated 
        me, creating the understandings that I have sought for so long. <br>
             There is so much scope for us to work in 
        our various fields, in assisting our clients to achieve the state of positive 
        health that is our natural birthright, and we can only be grateful for 
        the research that has done so much to further scientific understanding 
        of their processes.</font></p>
