<h1>My Cosmogyny</h1>





<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">Because,
as we all know, everything rots, rusts, breaks down, into simpler and
simpler units.  Every day brings us closer to death.  Daddy called it
“The Second Law of Thermodynamics:  You can’t shovel shit
into a horse and get hay.”</span></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">But,
 ‘in the beginning’, or sometime along there, a few
little bits and pieces decided to get more complicated, against all
the odds.  Why?  Is this the God(dess) principle?  So in the primeval
soup, some molecules got together and after a long time we had
something that was so complicated that it figured out how to
reproduce itself (was that viruses?  DNA?) and then there was a kind
of borderline situation and then something which we could call Life
started happening, only in a small way at first and then it got
bigger and more complicated and you don’t really want any more
detail ….. (some of it is very, very messy) and after a very
long time and a lot of false starts and dead ends, living things
began communicating (they had to, because by this time Life had
developed ways of reproducing itself – that’s the main
thing about Life, it seems to want to survive, and it seems to want
to continue the genetic line  (all except middle-class French women,
apparently, they have to be bribed) so the male and the female have
to have ways of making decisions about each other to do with
reproducing.  And then the big brains and small teeth came along, and
some of Life had to get together in groups to survive, and then there
was the lengthy maturation period, the protracted helplessness that
made the pair and the group even more necessary, and we began talking
to each other, and forming concepts, and doing some learning instead
of operating entirely by instinct (this is much more limited than we
would like to believe)  (the ‘not operating entirely by
instinct’, that is).  Then we started having Rules about
mating, and a lot of the Rules began to be about males making sure
the offspring were their own and not someone else’s, and the
Rules were said to have been made up by God, who was of course one of
the boys.  At some point along the way, the Rules began to insist
that the females were dangerous and evil, and what was most dangerous
and evil about them was their sexual desire.  If you don’t
believe this, read Revelations, with particular reference to The
Whore of Babylon – look deeply into other religions, seek out
their definition of the Root Of All Evil.  Buried in among all the
pretty language, you will find out that it is female sexual desire.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">And
thus began the big movement towards virginity, chastity, abstinence,
celibacy.  And The Devil, which is sexuality, Eve, the tempted and
the temptress, and the Whore, who is the woman who has desire –
Desire labelled as evil, driven underground, only to reappear in all
the aspects of perversion and sadism, from the Inquisition onward. 
(Witness the attitudes towards that contemporary Whore, the Single
Mother.)   Pornography thrives, rape and child abuse go relatively
unpunished.  The sexual frustration of young men is used for every
conceivable purpose, from selling cars to persuading them to become
suicide bombers.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">Let’s
start again, with the mythical Mother Goddess.  Let’s start
with that mysterious force which broke the rule that everything tends
to break down into simpler and simpler units – what was it,
what force of creativity led matter to become more complex?  Let us
call that a female principle, and begin to experience that principle,
which is expressed in the joy and delight connected to sexual, to
reproductive behaviour, the profound happiness which can be found in
loving connections to each other and to our children – it is
all part of the same thing – treasuring life, treasuring all
which conserves and continues life – making love is part of
this flow, and as part of this flow, is a sacred act.  Suppose we
think of our bodies, of our reproductive functions, as sacred
objects, sacred celebrations, to be approached with reverence and awe
– for ourselves, for each other, for the act itself.  </span>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">Of
course I am mad, am I not.  To think that, to begin to regard
ourselves in this way, might transform almost everything about how
our society operates.  </span>
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;" lang="en-GB">We have
suicide bombers, seduced by myths of 100 virgins waiting up in
heaven.  We have young men who never get drunk enough to dance.  We
have pornography, date rape, and experimenting with the new
pornography – maybe torture is acceptable after all?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;" lang="en-GB">Do I have
to go on?  
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;" lang="en-GB">Of course
it is mad to think that all the craziness which is sending the world
into ever more frightening currents and countercurrents of
destruction might be underpinned by our conviction that sex is evil. 
</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="en-GB">This
couldn’t possibly be true.</span></p>
